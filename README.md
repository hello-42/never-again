# never-again!
###### A filesystem installer for [Quenty's NevermoreEngine](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine)
---

This tool was made to take some of the pain out of project setup for people that primarily use platforms other than Roblox Studio, creating games that base themselves and their codebase in partially some or all of the NevermoreEngine. The tool automates the Git repository cloning process and Rojo project file setup process based off of the integration subdirectory of the engine's Github repository. The tool also provides some configuration settings that allow us to:

- Control default Nevermore module installation.
- Start Roblox Studio when our project's generation completes.
- Open Visual Studio Code in the directory of our project.
- Open our project's directory in Windows Explorer.
- Remove standard [NevermoreEngine/games/integration/](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine/tree/main/games/integration) files
- Remove standard Git files

### Feel free to use, change, and/or manipulate this tool in which ever way you'd like. Enjoy!

Thanks to [Quenty](https://github.com/Quenty) for inspiring the creation of this tool with the NevermoreEngine open source library for the Roblox game development community.
